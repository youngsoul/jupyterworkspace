    "In scikit-learn, the decision trees only implement *pre-pruning*, meaning that we can only control the depth of tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, sklearn's decision trees will use the training data until all of the leaves are *pure* meaning that each leaf contains only a single class.  This leads to overfitting and therefore does not allow the model to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "By pre-pruning, we can create a decision tree that generalizes to data that the model has not seen, and in doing so you will see the training accuracy go down. This is expected, because we did not allow the decision tree to create pure leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees have the advantage that they are invariant to scaling of the data.  Decision trees work well when you have features that are on completely different scales, or a mix of binary and continuous features.  For example, if you have a dataset that has category features, such as Airline Carrier code, and minutes of arrival delay.  You can convert the carrier code using dummy variables or one-hot-encoding, and then use a tree for the model"
